# **Roadmap for Email Spam Detector Project**

---

## **Week 1: Project Initialization**
- **Goals**: Understand the problem, plan, and set up the environment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Research spam detection methods (rules-based, ML-based, and hybrid).
  - Define the project's objective and draft the problem statement.
  - Finalize tools, technologies, and libraries (Python, TensorFlow/Scikit-Learn, etc.).
  - Gather corporate-related spam email datasets (e.g., Enron, SpamAssassin).
  - Plan dataset cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- **Deliverable**: Project plan, defined objectives, tools list, and acquired dataset.

---

## **Week 2: Dataset Preparation**
- **Goals**: Prepare the dataset for ML training.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement dataset cleaning: remove HTML tags, special characters, and redundant data.
  - Tokenize and preprocess text (stemming, lemmatization).
  - Apply feature extraction techniques (TF-IDF, n-grams, or embeddings like Word2Vec).
  - Handle data imbalance using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.
- **Deliverable**: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for model training.

---

## **Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Goals**: Understand dataset patterns and insights.
- **Tasks**:
  - Visualize data distributions (spam vs. non-spam).
  - Analyze word frequencies for spam and non-spam emails.
  - Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, word clouds, correlation heatmaps).
  - Identify dataset biases or anomalies.
- **Deliverable**: EDA report with visualizations and insights.

---

## **Week 4: Baseline Model Development**
- **Goals**: Develop a basic working model for spam detection.
- **Tasks**:
  - Train a baseline model (e.g., Naive Bayes) using the preprocessed dataset.
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Identify strengths and weaknesses of the baseline model.
- **Deliverable**: Baseline model with evaluation metrics.

---

## **Week 5: Advanced Model Training**
- **Goals**: Improve model performance using advanced techniques.
- **Tasks**:
  - Experiment with advanced models (SVM, Random Forest, LSTM, CNNs).
  - Fine-tune hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search.
  - Compare results of different models and select the best-performing one.
  - Start building the training pipeline for scalability.
- **Deliverable**: Optimized model with hyperparameter tuning results.

---

## **Week 6: Backend API Development**
- **Goals**: Create APIs to integrate the model with external systems.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop RESTful API endpoints using Flask or FastAPI:
    - `/classify_email`: Single email classification.
    - `/classify_emails`: Batch email classification.
  - Test API endpoints locally and validate model predictions.
- **Deliverable**: Functional backend API for spam classification.

---

## **Week 7: Frontend Integration**
- **Goals**: Build a simple and user-friendly interface.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design a web interface for users to upload emails and view classification results.
  - Integrate the frontend with the backend API.
  - Add basic analytics to display metrics (e.g., spam probability, classification history).
- **Deliverable**: Fully functional UI connected to the backend.

---

## **Week 8: Testing and Optimization**
- **Goals**: Ensure system robustness and reliability.
- **Tasks**:
  - Perform unit, integration, and system testing.
  - Optimize model inference speed (e.g., quantization, efficient data pipelines).
  - Conduct stress testing for high-volume email classifications.
- **Deliverable**: Bug-free and optimized system ready for deployment.

---

## **Week 9: Deployment Preparation**
- **Goals**: Prepare the system for deployment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up the cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
  - Deploy the backend API and model to the cloud.
  - Implement security measures (API keys, SSL/TLS encryption).
  - Add monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for performance tracking.
- **Deliverable**: Deployed spam detection system in the cloud.

---

## **Week 10: Documentation and Final Presentation**
- **Goals**: Finalize project and prepare for evaluation.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write technical documentation (project architecture, API endpoints, usage manual).
  - Create a final presentation (slides, system demo, performance metrics).
  - Rehearse and deliver the presentation.
- **Deliverable**: Complete project submission, including code, documentation, and presentation materials.
